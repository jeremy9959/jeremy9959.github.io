(to the tune of “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Settler%27s_Song_%28Acres_of_Clams%29">Acres of Clams</a>” aka “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Rosin_the_Beau">Rosin Le Beau</a>”)</p>

<p>
When I was a faculty member,<br />
My pen dripped with acid and bile,<br />
And no university leader,<br />
Was safe from satirical fire.

<p>
But it’s hard to be funny as dean, boys,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean,<br />
Satire’s a tool of the masses, boys,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean.</p>

<p>I’d never make fun of the provost,<br />
His wisdom and judgment are pure,<br />
He’s far above humor and jest, boys,<br />
I’d like to keep my job secure.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px" dir="ltr">It’s hard to be funny as dean, boys,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean,<br />
You can orate, debate, and proclaim, boys,<br />
But it’s hard to be funny as dean.</p>
<p>The president’s words are like honey,<br />
Her vision inspires us all,<br />
She’s out on the road raising money, but<br />
She could fire me with a phone call.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px" dir="ltr">It’s hard to be funny as dean, boys,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean,<br />
Better keep counting those beans, boys,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean.</p>
<p>I work with the heads of departments,<br />
On budgets and staff we agree,<br />
I’ve nary a doubt of their talents,<br />
There are 20 of them and there’s me.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px" dir="ltr">It’s hard to be funny as dean, boys,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean,<br />
You need to inspire and lead, boys,<br />
it’s hard to be funny as dean.</p>
<p>The faculty’s brilliance is legend,<br />
Their research earns worldwide respect,<br />
Whatever they want I will give them,<br />
I don’t want to get them upset.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px" dir="ltr">It’s hard to be funny as dean, boys,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean,<br />
You have to wear ties and speak wisely,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean.</p>
<p>My deanship will someday expire,<br />
To the faculty I will ascend,<br />
And then I’ll be free to write satire,<br />
And not be afraid to offend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px" dir="ltr">It’s hard to be funny as dean, boys,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean,<br />
Satire’s the tool of the masses, boys,<br />
It’s hard to be funny as dean.</p>
