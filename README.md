### Work:

- [Lectures (and Videos) on topics in Machine Learning](ML.html)

### Teaching:

During Fall of 2022, I will be teaching the graduate abstract algebra course, Math 5210,
at UConn.  Course materials are under development. 

### Course Materials

- [Abstract Algebra](https://jeremy9959.net/2021-Fall-3230-Math) Materials for the Intro to Abstract Algebra Course at UConn. Based on [Judson's Abstract Algebra](http://abstract.ups.edu/) book.  Videos and Notes. 
- [Transition to Higher Mathematics](https://jeremy9959.net/2020-Fall-2710W-Math),  Materials for the "Intro to Proofs" course at UConn.  Follows [The Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/) by Hammack.  Videos and Notes.
- [Honors Seminar on Machine Learning](https://jeremy9959.net/Math-3094-UConn), Course, UConn, Spring 2022.  Notes and videos on selected topics.

### Machine Learning Visualization and related Projects:

- [Wallpaper Groups](https://observablehq.com/@jeremy9959/the-plane-symmetry-groups/2) -- visualization of the 17 plane symmetry groups
- [Bokeh Theme Builder](https://bokehthemebuilder.herokuapp.com) -- a tool to build themes for the plotting package [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org).
- [Polya's Urn](https://polyas-urn.herokuapp.com)
- [Disassembling a Bokeh Model](./structure_graph.html) -- [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) is a visualization
library that I've gotten quite interested in.  This is the output of a tool that shows the structure of
a bokeh plot interactively.
- [Bokeh, Bokehjs, and Observablehq](https://towardsdatascience.com/bokeh-bokehjs-and-observablehq-6ddf0c5ffe8a)
- [Sequential Minimal Optimization](https://observablehq.com/@jeremy9959/smo-algorithm) finds the closest
points in the convex hull of two linearly separable point sets.  The animation at the top of this page
came from this notebook.

### Banjo

I'm a student of clawhammer and two-finger style old-time banjo.  Here is a two-finger arrangement of New Five Cent
I wrote as an "assignment" by my teacher [Matt Brown](https://twofingerbanjo.com).
