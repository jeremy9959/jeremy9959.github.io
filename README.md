### Data Science

I am the Director of UConn's [MS in Data Science](https://masters.datascience.uconn.edu), a one-year professional Master's degree.

### Work

- [Lectures (and Videos) on topics in Machine Learning](ML.html)

### Teaching

During Fall of 2024, I will be teaching:

- The introductory course _Fundamentals of Data Science_ (Grad 5100) for the [MS program in Data Science](https://masters.datascience.uconn.edu).
- Introduction to Linear Algebra, Math 2210Q.

### Course Materials

- [Abstract Algebra](https://jeremy9959.net/2021-Fall-3230-Math) Materials for the Intro to Abstract Algebra Course at UConn. Based on [Judson's Abstract Algebra](http://abstract.ups.edu/) book. Videos and Notes.
- [Transition to Higher Mathematics](https://jeremy9959.net/2020-Fall-2710W-Math), Materials for the "Intro to Proofs" course at UConn. Follows [The Book of Proof](https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/) by Hammack. Videos and Notes.

### Machine Learning Visualization and related Projects:

- [Row Reduction (JS)](./rref.html) -- Not machine learning, but useful for linear algebra class. A javascript step-by-step row reduction tool for pedagogical purposes.
- [Wallpaper Groups](https://observablehq.com/@jeremy9959/the-plane-symmetry-groups/2) -- visualization of the 17 plane symmetry groups
- [Disassembling a Bokeh Model](./structure_graph.html) -- [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) is a visualization
  library that I've gotten quite interested in. This is the output of a tool that shows the structure of
  a bokeh plot interactively.
- [Bokeh, Bokehjs, and Observablehq](https://towardsdatascience.com/bokeh-bokehjs-and-observablehq-6ddf0c5ffe8a)
- [Sequential Minimal Optimization](https://observablehq.com/@jeremy9959/smo-algorithm) finds the closest
  points in the convex hull of two linearly separable point sets. The animation at the top of this page
  came from this notebook.

### Fun

- [It's Hard to Be Funny as Dean](ItsHardToBeFunnyAsDean.md) -- a song written during my stint as Dean of CLAS at UConn.
- [I am the very model of a Provost Acadmical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn_P-lxrju8) -- a pastiche composed in honor of Peter Nicholls's retirement as Provost from UConn.

### Banjo

I'm a student of clawhammer and two-finger style old-time banjo. Some videos of my playing are available on [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA1BW10SyK-G2AJlajKY99w). Here is a two-finger arrangement of New Five Cent
I wrote as an "assignment" by my teacher [Matt Brown](https://twofingerbanjo.com).

[Here is the tool I wrote to help with writing this sort of tablature using lilypond](https://jeremy9959.net/BanjoTab).
