### Work:

- [Lectures (and Videos) on topics in Machine Learning](ML.html)

### Teaching:
- [Abstract Algebra](https://jeremy9959.net/2021-Fall-3230-Math), UConn, Fall 2021.  Materials for the Intro to Abstract Algebra Course at UConn. Based on [Judson's Abstract Algebra](http://abstract.ups.edu/) book.  Videos and Notes. 
- [Transition to Higher Mathematics](https://jeremy9959.net/2020-Fall-2710W-Math), UConn, Fall, 2020. Thanks to the pandemic, this link takes you to pretty complete materials for an online course including links to video lectures.
- [Honors Seminar on Machine Learning](https://jeremy9959.net/Math-3094-Spring-2021), Course, UConn, Spring 2021.
This is an undergraduate topics course co-taught with [Kyu-Hwan Lee](https://www2.math.uconn.edu/~khlee/)
- [Mathematical Aspects of Machine Learning](https://jeremy9959.net/Math-5800-Spring-2020), Course, UConn, Spring 2020.
This was a Master's level, project-based seminar course.

### Machine Learning Visualization and related Projects:

- [Wallpaper Groups](https://observablehq.com/@jeremy9959/the-plane-symmetry-groups/2) -- visualization of the 17 plane symmetry groups
- [Bokeh Theme Builder](https://bokehthemebuilder.herokuapp.com) -- a tool to build themes for the plotting package [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org).
- [Polya's Urn](https://polyas-urn.herokuapp.com)
- [Disassembling a Bokeh Model](./structure_graph.html) -- [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) is a visualization
library that I've gotten quite interested in.  This is the output of a tool that shows the structure of
a bokeh plot interactively.
- [Bokeh, Bokehjs, and Observablehq](https://towardsdatascience.com/bokeh-bokehjs-and-observablehq-6ddf0c5ffe8a)
- [Sequential Minimal Optimization](https://observablehq.com/@jeremy9959/smo-algorithm) finds the closest
points in the convex hull of two linearly separable point sets.  The animation at the top of this page
came from this notebook.

### Banjo

I'm a student of clawhammer and two-finger style old-time banjo.  Here is a two-finger arrangement of New Five Cent
I wrote as an "assignment" by my teacher [Matt Brown](https://twofingerbanjo.com).
